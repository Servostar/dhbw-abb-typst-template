For this reason pull request opened at any mirror such as on GitHub, will not be
merged as this would compromise the push mirror.

Pull requests shall be opened exclusively in the official
[repository](https://git.montehaselino.de/DHBW/dhbw-abb-typst-template).
Issues may be created at GitHub or the official repository.
Beware, that linked pull requests and issues in commits messages refer to those
in the official instance and may be broken or invalid on mirrors such as GitHub.

Direct pushes to the `main` branch are discouraged. In order to make a change
create a new pull request and wait for a maintainer to merge it. Note that in
order to be able to merge, the continuous integration pipeline must run
successfully.
